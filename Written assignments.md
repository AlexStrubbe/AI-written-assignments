What is your personal definition of intelligence
======================================

### My interpretation of intelligence is the capability to make the correct or best decision when encountering a problem. When encountering a problem there are many solutions to said problem, therefore I can also add that it can be the most optimal way to solve a problem. Example, when taking a fruit down a tall tree we have many options, we can throw an object so the fruit falls, but this is not that intelligent since you can damage the product if not handled correctly, we can also get a ladder to get the fruit which can mitigate the damage to the fruit but increase the chances of an accident (since the user can fall from the ladder) or we can use a pole with a net to grab the fruit which can mitigate the damage to the fruit and user. The ability to make smart and efficient solutions to problems is the best way I can describe intelligence.

When asked "What is intelligence?" I quickly went to my favorite YouTube channel called Kurzgesagt–In a Nutshell and wasn't disappointed with his explanation. He states that intelligence is a very broad term to grasp since it can mean many things, from instinct to actual critical thinking. One of the examples he gives is a mold called Physarum Polycephalum, a mold that makes trails of goo that it uses to mark already taken paths. This mold was previously used for its great capabilities for optimization to design Tokyo's subway system. Although this mold doesn't have a brain or anything similar, the behavior it gives for problem solving can be considered a type of intelligence. 
Kurzgesagt defines intelligence as a toolbox in which 3 main aspects pop out, Information, Memory and Learning. I agree in the sense that they define most of intelligent behavior in animals.

Information- is basically the way we get said information, be it by the 5 senses or instinct.
Memory- is the way we recall previous information that may be considered important (ie, water and sources).
Learning- is how we take a series of memories placed together for future use (ie, baby birds learning to fly by repeatedly mooving their wings).

These are some of the aspects that he defines in his video, but the ones that I think are more important are what he calls "Advanced tools" such as creativity and planning, devising various ways to solve a problem and thinking of new ways to solve said problem which I think is what most engineers do. They use previously learned skills and knowledge to devise new and creative ways to solve a set of problems.

PEAS for Agents - Spot, For the Visually Impaired
=========================================

For centuries, dogs have earned the cherished title of "man's best friend," exemplifying their unparalleled versatility as both companions and indispensable aids. Celebrated for their sociable demeanor, dogs seamlessly integrate into human life while showcasing remarkable adaptability across various roles. Notably, their invaluable assistance to visually impaired individuals has revolutionized mobility, granting them autonomy comparable to sighted individuals. Whether navigating bustling urban streets or leisurely strolling through serene landscapes, these faithful companions serve as steadfast guides, enriching the lives of those they accompany.

Yet, a compelling question emerges: How can we harness the essence of canine assistance and enhance its utility? Enter Spot—a groundbreaking quadruped robot meticulously engineered for unparalleled mobility across diverse terrains. Equipped with an intricate sensor suite and three motors per leg, Spot demonstrates exceptional agility and balance in traversing both indoor and outdoor environments [1].

Spot's functionality extends beyond manual operation, offering autonomous capabilities driven by sophisticated sensors and artificial intelligence. With integrations like GPS, LiDAR, and advanced imagery processing software, Spot will be able to meticulously chart the safest routes and identify potential obstacles, ensuring the secure navigation of visually impaired individuals through various environments. Unlike biological counterparts, Spot's mechanical nature eliminates distractions during duty, guaranteeing unwavering focus on its user's safety.

Furthermore, Spot's integration with a speech modulator enhances user interaction by providing real-time hazard identification and navigational assistance. As a non-biological entity, Spot circumvents restrictions faced by traditional pets, enabling access to areas typically off-limits to animals and emphasizing its utility as an indispensable aid.

Customizability lies at the heart of Spot's design, allowing tailored adaptation to individual user requirements. With limitless potential for customization, Spot emerges as a versatile ally, adeptly fulfilling diverse needs and scenarios with unparalleled efficacy.
